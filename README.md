# Overview

"School Raid" is a captivating 2D game created in C# using the Unity3D game engine, launched in August 2020. Initially available on both the App Store and Google Play, it has since been unpublished due to the discontinuation of service payments.

As the sole creator of this project, I took charge of every aspect of its development. This includes writing all the code, designing and drawing the sprites, creating the audio and music, and developing the animations. Moreover, the conceptualization, game design, and all other creative elements were also my responsibility.
